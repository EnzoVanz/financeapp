- PostgreSQL database (we use Neon.tech)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EnzoVanz/financeapp.git
   cd financeapp
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables
   ```bash
   # Copy example env files
   cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
   # Then edit .env with your database credentials
   ```

4. Start development servers
   You'll need to run both the frontend and backend servers in separate terminals:

   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Run backend
   pnpm api:dev

   # Terminal 2 - Run frontend
   pnpm web:dev

   # Alternative: Run just what you need
   pnpm dev        # Runs only frontend
   pnpm api:dev    # Runs only backend
   ```

   The application will be available at:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend: http://localhost:3001

## Database Management

This project uses Neon.tech for PostgreSQL hosting. You can manage your database through:

1. **Neon Console**
   - View and manage tables
   - Run SQL queries
   - Monitor performance
   - Set up development branches

2. **Prisma Studio**
   ```bash
   cd apps/api
   npx prisma studio
   ```
